# KernelBridge: Advanced iOS Kernel Interaction Framework

**KernelBridge** is a powerful Objective-C framework for interacting with the XNU kernel on iOS devices. It provides low-level access to kernel memory, task ports, and system calls, enabling advanced research and development for jailbreak tools and security analysis.

## Features:
- Kernel memory read/write primitives
- AMFI and codesigning patches
- Sandbox escape techniques
- Kernel task port access
- Mach-O and memory manipulation utilities

**Warning**: This project is for research purposes only. Use at your own risk on non-production devices.

## Supported Environments:
- iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1 (partial)
- ARM64 devices (A9 - A15)
- Requires kernel vulnerability exploit
